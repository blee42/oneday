# One Day In

We are currently experiencing technical difficulties after the Heroku app upgrade to MonogoLab 3. Fixes are in progress.

## Preface

Variety: a dilemna. Though overwhelmingly appreciated, multitudes of options tend to foster indecision. Individual citizens, swarmed with masses of choices of things to do and sights to see often settle for what's comfortable and easy, falling in line with a consistent schedule. One Day In means to push those limits and make decisions. After a small calibration of preferences, One Day In plans a full and efficient day in any major city in the United States and many beyond. Let One Day In take charge of perusing though innumerable options and finding what best suits individuals.
